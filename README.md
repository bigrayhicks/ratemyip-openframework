Securityrating.io lets know the vulnerability risk of your IP address or domain.

## Intro

For over two years we've been collecting internet data and watched as IP Addresses and Domains expose an ever growing number of services to the internet.
We've also seen over the last year a trend where insurance companies with products in cyber-insurance will create their own ratings. We started looking into these issues and by talking to the insurance companies we heard a common set of complaints:
* They don't know how to rate "cyber"
* They lack valuable data to calculate premiums
* There is a lack of standard on rating systems for "cyber", which makes life difficult for cyber-insurers

When we heard this, we felt there was a need for an open-framework, where the formula to calculate these ratings is exposed to the public, so that, both a standard can be created and people can understand exactly how they are being rated.

This is our first attempt at creating this open-framework.
